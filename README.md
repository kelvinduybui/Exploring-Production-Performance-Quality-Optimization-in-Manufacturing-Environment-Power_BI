## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Context

üìò **Main Context**  
- **Production requests** come from Planning ‚Üí after **Procurement** secures raw materials, production starts.  
- **Finished goods** stored across warehouses; completion time may not always match plan.  
- **Quality checks** at warehouse entry remove defective products.  
- Task: Build a **Power BI Operations Dashboard** for the **Production Director** to get clear insights, make better decisions, and improve operations.  

üë• **Target Audience**  
- **Primary Stakeholder**: Head of Production
- **Secondary Stakeholders**: Warehouse Department, Quality Control Department, Planning Department

üéØ **Objective**   
Provide the stakeholders with a clear and interactive dashboard to monitor manufacturing performance, track inventory and quality, and support data-driven operational decisions.  

üõ†Ô∏è **Tools Used**  
- **Power BI**: For data integration, production & inventory monitoring, quality control tracking, and interactive operational dashboards

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Insights & Recommendations
### Production insights  
- **Work Orders & Status**:  
  - A total of **72.59K Work Orders** were recorded.  
  - **31.4% (22.79K)** were delayed ‚Üí a relatively high percentage, significantly impacting **production efficiency**.  

- **Production & Delay Time**:  
  - **Average manufacturing time**: 13.24 days.  
  - **Average delay time**: 8.44 days (‚âà 64% of total production time) ‚Üí delays are **severe**.  

- **Products**:  
  - **BB Ball Bearing** is the leading product with **0.91M units**, nearly double the second-highest (**Seat Stays**).  
  - Other key products include **Seat Stays, Blade, Fork End, and Chain Stays**.  

- **Cost & Labor Hours by Location**:  
  - **Frame** and **Final Assembly** incur the **highest costs and labor hours**.  
  - **Paint** and **Deburr** require the least.  
  - Bottlenecks are concentrated in **Frame** and **Final Assembly** stages.  

- **Delay Trend by Year**:  
  - Delay rates increased from **~28% in 2011** to **~34% in 2014**.  
  - Late deliveries are **worsening over time** and not yet effectively resolved.  

- **Scheduled vs Actual Producing Days**:  
  - **Actual production days** consistently exceed **scheduled days**, highlighting **inaccurate planning**.   

### Production recommendation  
- **Improve Planning & Scheduling**  
  - Enhance **forecasting accuracy** for production time, especially in **Frame** and **Final Assembly**.  
  - Consider applying **Production Scheduling Optimization** or **Simulation models** to minimize planning gaps.  

- **Reduce Delay Rate**  
  - Investigate root causes of delays (e.g., **material shortages, machine downtime, labor shortages**).  
  - Prioritize **process improvements** for high-volume products such as **BB Ball Bearing**.  

- **Optimize Costs by Location**  
  - Since **Frame** and **Final Assembly** are cost/time-intensive, evaluate **automation** or **line balancing** to reduce bottlenecks.  

- **Develop Long-term KPIs**  
  - Target reducing the **delay rate** from **31.4% ‚Üí below 20%** within 1‚Äì2 years.  
  - Target reducing the **gap between Scheduled vs Actual Days** to **<10%**.

### Inventory insights  
- **Overall Inventory**:  
  - **Total Inventory**: 335.97K units.  
  - **50 Overstock cases** and **4 Stockouts**, with **848 Reorders** needed.  

- **Inventory by Location**:  
  - Inventory is heavily concentrated in **Subassembly** and **Miscellaneous Storage**, holding the **highest stock levels**.  
  - Downstream locations like **Paint Shop & Storage** hold significantly less inventory ‚Üí **imbalance across the production chain**.  

- **Inventory by Category**:  
  - **Components** dominate inventory with **40K+ units**, much higher than other categories.  
  - **Bikes** and **Accessories** follow, while **Clothing** contributes the least.  

- **Stockout vs. Overstock**:  
  - Both **Stockouts (4)** and **Overstock (50)** cases fall under **PriceLevel = Normal**.  
  - Pricing is not the main driver ‚Üí issues stem from **planning, forecasting, and supply chain execution gaps**.
    
### Inventory recommendations  
- **Balance Inventory Across Locations**  
  - Reduce excessive stock at **Subassembly/Miscellaneous Storage** and redistribute to **downstream stages**.  
  - Apply **line balancing** or **Kanban systems** for smoother inventory flow.  

- **Reduce Overstock**  
  - Analyze the **50 Overstock cases** (e.g., forecasting errors, overproduction, low sales).  
  - Apply **ABC/XYZ analysis** to better align stock with **demand variability**.  

- **Set KPI Targets**  
  - **Reduce Stockouts**: from **4 cases ‚Üí 0** (short-term).  
  - **Cut Overstock**: by **30‚Äì40% within 1 year**.  
  - **Improve Reordering**: keep **‚ÄúReorder Needed‚Äù < 5% of total SKUs** through better **forecasting** and **supplier lead time control**.
  
### Quality Control insights  
- **Overall Scrap Performance**:  
  - **Scrap rate**: 24% ‚Üí relatively high.  
  - **Total scrap cost**: ~$359.95K.  
  - **729 Work Orders** affected, generating **11K+ scrap products**.  

- **By Year**:  
  - Scrap rate rose from **~12% in 2011 ‚Üí ~29% in 2013**, then dropped to **~20% in 2014**.  
  - Indicates **improvement after 2013**, but performance remains **unstable**.  

- **By Location**:  
  - Highest scrap in **Subassembly (21%)**, followed by **Frame Welding (18%)** and **Frame Forming (18%)**.  
  - Most scrap originates from **early-stage production processes**.  

- **By Scrap Reason**:  
  - Top reasons: **Seat assembly not as ordered (3.1%)**, **Drill size too large (2.9%)**, **Paint process failed (2.9%)**, **Trim length too long (2.9%)**.  
  - Issues mainly tied to **machine setup** and **quality inspection processes**.  

- **By Product**:  
  - Scrap rates across products are **relatively high**, often **>50%**.  
  - Critical cases: **ML Road Frame ‚Äì Red (75%)** and **Mountain-100 Black (63%)**.  
  - Suggests quality issues are **widespread across multiple SKUs**.  

### Quality Control recommendations  
- **Target High-Scrap Products**  
  - Prioritize process review for **top 3 products** with highest scrap rates.  
  - Apply **root cause analysis** (Fishbone, 5 Whys) to identify design, material, or process issues.  

- **Improve Subassembly & Welding**  
  - Enhance **machine calibration** and **operator training** in high-scrap stages.  
  - Implement **early-stage quality checkpoints** to prevent downstream defects.  

- **Cost Reduction Strategy**  
  - A **10% scrap reduction** could save **~$36K**.  
  - Focus on processes with **high cost + high scrap rate**.  

- **Sustain Quality Improvement**  
  - Develop a **Scrap KPI dashboard** with **weekly/monthly tracking**.  
  - Adopt **Kaizen / Lean Six Sigma** to maintain scrap levels **<15%**.
